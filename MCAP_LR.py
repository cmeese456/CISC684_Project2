# Divide the training set into two sets using a 70/30 split.

# Learn parameters using the 70% split

# Use the 30% of data as a validation set to select lambda

# Then use selected value of Lambda to learn parameters from the full training set

# Use gradient ascent for learning the weights (set appropriate learning rate)
# Implement a hard limit on the number of iterations for gradient ascent

# Implement the algorithm
